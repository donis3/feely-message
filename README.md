**Feely Message** is a fullstack Next.JS 13.4 Application.
This project is part of my portfolio.

### Motivation

This app was created to learn and practice [Next.JS](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) App Router and [Server Components.](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/react-essentials#server-components)

### Tech Stack

- [**Next.JS 13.4.2**](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) : The core of the application. Handles both frontend and backend requests. I've used both server components to fetch db data and api routes to learn about both.
- [**NextAuth**](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth) : Handles the app authentication along with google auth provider. Stores users & sessions in firestore db.
- [**FireBase**](https://github.com/firebase/): Firestore database for my data storage with a generous free tier
- [**Tailwind Css**](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss): My component styles are done inline using tailwind
- [**Shadcn/UI**](https://github.com/shadcn/ui): Cards, buttons, dialog components etc... Great resource with built in accessibility. These components are built on top of [RadixUi](https://github.com/radix-ui) primitives with minimal styling

### Deployment

Application is deployed to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) free tier.
